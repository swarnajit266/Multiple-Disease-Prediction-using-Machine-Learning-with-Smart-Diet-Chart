# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Smart Diet Chart
## 🔹 Overview
*This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases using machine learning models and provides a personalized diet chart to promote a healthy lifestyle. The main aim is to integrate disease prediction with smart diet recommendations for improved user well-being.*


## 🛠 Tech Stack:
### 1.Frontend
- HTML : Structuring the web pages.
- CSS : Styling and designing a responsive UI.
- JavaScript : Enhancing interactivity and dynamic content handling.

### 2.Backend
- Flask : Python-based micro web framework used to connect the ML model with the frontend.

### 3.Machine Learning & Data Processing

- Python Libraries:

    - NumPy – Numerical computations and array operations.

    - Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing.

    - Scikit-learn – Building and training ML models for disease prediction.


## ⚙️ Features
### 1.Multiple Disease Prediction

- Supports prediction for different diseases (e.g., Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, etc.).

- Uses pre-trained ML models with accuracy-optimized algorithms.

### 2.Smart Diet Chart Recommendation

- Provides a customized diet plan based on the user details.

- Aims to guide users toward healthier food choices.

## 3.User-Friendly Web Interface

- Simple, intuitive, and mobile-friendly design for easy usage.

## 4.Backend Integration

- Flask API connects the trained ML model to the frontend, enabling real-time prediction.
  
## 📂 Workflow
**User Input** → The user enters health-related data through the web form.

**Data Processing** → The data is preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy.

**Prediction** → ML model (Scikit-learn) predicts the probability of a disease.

**Diet Chart Generation** → Based on results, a suitable diet plan is displayed.
